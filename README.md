# coursera-rep
Hi, In this repository, I will be uploading coding referencing Python libraries such as Pandas, numPy, beautifulsoup, Kivy, seaborn etc.
I will be performing practical exercises and uploading my coding rubric for everyone's references as part of Coursera IBM Skills Network Program 'Practical Project for Python'
During the exercises, beautifulsoup will be utilized for Datascraping and so on as part of the Coursera Practical exercises
